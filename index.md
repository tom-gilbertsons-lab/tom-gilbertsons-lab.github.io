My group investigates abnormal structure and function relationships in neural circuit disorders of the human brain.
These include Parkinson's disease, Essential Tremor and Dystonia. We study patients with using techniques developed from 
human neuroscience , including computational modeling of decision making, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 
diffusion tensor imaging and event related EEG. 

A particular focus is applying quanitatitive imaging analysis methods to two major research themes:
* improving outcomes from focused ultrasound lesion therapy in Essential Tremor and Parkinson's disease
* using focused ultrasound neuromodulation to identify new targets for non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease such as apathy.
